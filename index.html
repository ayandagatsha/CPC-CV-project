                    I work remotely full-time for CommissionCrowd, an

                    I've been awarded scholarships for work, efforts and character they assessed I 
                    displayed in their experience with me. I'm directly mentored by it's CEO Laura McGregor, I've 
                    worked with the Chief Marketing Officer and Director of Customer Success.

    <h3>Skills</h3>

    <p>
        Outside of having had an interest in technology my whole life, the recent years have seen me hone
        web development skills through various projects assigned by lecturers and tutors that
        led my part time studies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below is a short video showing the skills of analyzing a problem, formulating a solution 
        and improving upon the solution. By the end, I built myself a nice enough web application,
        using node.js, the Mongo Database and the usual front end files (HTML, CSS and JS).
